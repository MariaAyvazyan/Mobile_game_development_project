# Mobile_game_development_project

## Project description.

Imagine you work for a company that develops mobile games. A manager came to you and ask to analyze several aspects of a mobile app:

First of all, he wants to know the user's retention rate. Write a function to calculate it.
Moreover, the company conducted A/B testing to compare two types of promotional offer sets. Based on the available data, determine which set can be considered the best, and which metrics you base your decision on.
Offer some metrics which can help to evaluate the results of the latest themed game event.
 
Task 1
Retention is one of the company's most important metrics. Your task is to write a function that will count the players' retention rate (by days from the registration date).

The function must be written in Python. It can be tasted either on the full dataset or a data sample.

Task 2
You have the results of an A/B test in which two groups of users were offered different promotional sets. It is known that ARPU in the test group is 5% higher than in the control group. At the same time, in the control group, 1928 players out of 202103 turned out to be paying, and in the test group - 1805 out of 202667.

What promotional set can be considered the best? What metrics should be analyzed to make the right decision and how?

Task 3
Plants & Gardens game has a limited-time themed event every month. In these events, players can get unique items for their virtual garden and the characters, as well as additional coins or bonuses. To receive a reward, you need to complete a series of levels in a certain amount of time. 
What metrics can be used to evaluate the results of the latest themed event?

Suppose that in another event, we made it harder for players to succeed in the event. Now, with each unsuccessful attempt to complete the level, the player will roll back several levels. Will the set of performance evaluation metrics change? If so, how?
